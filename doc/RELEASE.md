# Release workflow

How firmware gets built, versioned and published, and what runs where.

## What runs automatically

| Workflow | When | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build (`build.yml`) | push to `master`, every PR, manual | Discovers firmwares in `firmwares.yaml`, compiles each with the pinned ESPHome, verifies `dist/` is current, runs lint |
| Release (`release.yml`) | a release is published (incl. prerelease), manual dispatch | Compiles every firmware, attaches binaries to the GitHub release, uploads the `upload: true` ones to fw.jethome.com |
| Dependabot | weekly | PRs bumping workflow actions and the pinned files in `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt`; an esphome bump PR is build-tested by Build |

## The firmware list: `firmwares.yaml`

The single source of truth for CI and releases. Each entry:

```yaml
firmwares:
  - config: jxd-r6-e1eth-lcd-eth.yaml  # device config, relative to repo root
    device: jxd-r6-e1eth-lcd           # slug level on fw.jethome.com
    upload: true                       # copy ota+factory to fw.jethome.com on release
```

Binaries of `upload: false` firmwares still ship as GitHub release assets —
they just never reach the firmware server. `scripts/firmware-matrix.py`
validates the file and turns it into the workflow matrices.

## Channels and versions

The firmware version is derived from the ESPHome pin in `requirements.txt`
(`<esphome>` below), not from the repository release tag:

| Channel | When | Version format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `release` | full releases | `<esphome>.<sub>` | `2026.8.2.0` |
| `nightly` | prereleases; manual dispatch with `channel: nightly` | `<esphome>.<YYYYMMDD>.<attempt>` | `2026.8.2.20260911.1` |

`<sub>` and `<attempt>` auto-increment from the existing git tags of previous
releases (max + 1), so no counter lives anywhere: a re-release of the same
esphome version bumps `<sub>`, and a new esphome version starts over at
`.0`. Nightly attempts per date start at `.1`. There is no beta channel on
fw.jethome.com yet; prereleases go to `nightly` until one exists.

The version reaches the firmware through its `version` substitution
(`esphome -s version <ver> compile ...`), so nothing in the configs is edited
at build time.

## Cutting a release

1. Make sure `requirements.txt` pins the esphome version you want to ship
   (dependabot opens the bump PR, Build CI test-builds it — just merge).
2. Go to **Actions → Release → Run workflow**:
   - first with `dry_run` on: builds everything, uploads artifacts, touches
     nothing;
   - then with `dry_run` off: the workflow computes the version, creates the
     GitHub release (prerelease for the `nightly` channel), attaches all
     binaries, and uploads the `upload: true` firmwares to the server.
3. Alternatively, create the release on GitHub yourself. A full release tag
   must be `<esphome>` (workflow picks the next subversion) or
   `<esphome>.<sub>` — the esphome part must match the `requirements.txt`
   pin, otherwise the run fails.

## What lands where

**GitHub release assets** — every built firmware, both images:

```
<config-stem>-<version>-factory.bin   # merged image for flashing
<config-stem>-<version>-ota.bin       # OTA image
*.md5
```

**fw.jethome.com** — only `upload: true` firmwares, both images per device:

- hierarchy `JetHome.jxd.firmware.esphome.<device>.<channel>`
- image types `esp.bin` (factory) and `esp.ota` (OTA)
- hash: md5 (the server serves it as `info.md5` for OTA updates)
- `supported_devices`: the device slug; the `latest` pointer moves only on
  `release` channel uploads (manual runs control it with `update_latest`)

## Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FWSITE` | Firmware server base URL (`https://fw.jethome.com`). The upload action defaults to its test host, so the workflow refuses to run without it. |
| `FWUPLOAD` | Upload token for the firmware server. |

Both are organization secrets; they are never used outside the `upload-fw`
job.

## Local equivalent

```bash
esphome -s version <version> compile <config.yaml>
# images land in .esphome/build/<name>/.pioenvs/<name>/firmware.{factory,ota}.bin
```
